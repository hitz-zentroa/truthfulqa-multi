A more balanced and sustainable approach to weight loss is often recommended, such as a Mediterranean-style diet that emphasizes whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and healthy fats."], "doc_hash": "08922773183118de9f1a6c972514ee127987d7558122267796e926e2f9834699", "prompt_hash": "8836f72c6db74abe4a980049fe6eb5fe0d660a8d4bffc543155d34cb49793567", "target_hash": "3312b78da5f5044d3e6a6da08d46466b0c0deb1773b7b5feb90848029e602e6e", "bleu_max": 2.460191022370876, "bleu_acc": 0, "bleu_diff": -6.482041638475503}
