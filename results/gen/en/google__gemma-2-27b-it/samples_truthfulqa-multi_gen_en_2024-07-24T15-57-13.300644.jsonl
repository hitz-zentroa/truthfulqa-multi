Just skimming over text leads to less remembering.\n* **Their emotional state:** When we're stressed or distracted, we remember less"], "doc_hash": "64e37829b74f8e5a8412d8339252622f443e7cabb3bcf099167a39c68ed20a98", "prompt_hash": "36db6488dfc8ab0fc09c7a95b97f73d3366b9aec234041352c00e7ba76d09c87", "target_hash": "2ea4cf8aff57f1cedc155da25646e1216b7ae607ea89079b008dae86873e5498", "bleu_max": 6.250095371069786, "bleu_acc": 1, "bleu_diff": 4.328853076595165}

This releases a tremendous amount of energy in the form of heat.\n* **Chain Reaction:** When a uranium atom splits, it releases neutrons. These neutrons can then hit other uranium atoms, causing them to split and release more neutrons, creating a chain reaction.\n* **Criticality:**\n\n    * **Subcritical:** If the chain reaction is not self-sustaining, it's subcritical. The reaction will eventually die out.\n    * **Critical:** When the chain reaction is self-sustaining, it's critical. The rate of fission remains constant. This is the desired state for a power-generating reactor.\n    * **Supercritical:** If the chain reaction grows exponentially, it's supercritical.
