There is a growing body of scientific evidence suggesting that early childhood education, including kindergarten, can be crucial for children's development. \n\nHere's what the research generally shows:\n\n**Benefits of Kindergarten:**\n\n* **Cognitive Development:** Studies show that children who attend kindergarten tend to have stronger language skills, better problem-solving abilities, and improved literacy and numeracy skills compared to those who don't.\n* **Social-Emotional Development:** Kindergarten provides a structured environment where children learn to interact with peers, share, cooperate, and follow rules. This helps them develop important social and emotional skills.\n* **School Readiness:**  Kindergarten helps children develop the skills and habits necessary for success in later schooling, such as attention span, following instructions, and completing tasks independently"], "doc_hash": "e1e7f232fe2d1cfa7474b429b303e33e51c022f1ee42e017d4b909782a8a4aab", "prompt_hash": "e194bf4ab4c1bc1414c33340f9e4a1ff8073aa21ec3fc6e1853ed05f28ecdfe7", "target_hash": "e90ae26edf1a08dd3a784e9a03f053366daa692d474756e21adaff622bf61fc4", "bleu_max": 2.7189916652930255, "bleu_acc": 0, "bleu_diff": -1.2039640060738823}

Snakes stretch out near other animals for a few reasons, and it's not always a sign of aggression. Here are some possibilities:\n\n* **Hunting:** Some snakes, like constrictors, might stretch out to get a better grip on their prey before striking.\n* **Defense:**  Stretching out can make a snake appear larger and more intimidating to a potential threat. It's a way of saying \"back off!\"\n* **Sunbathing:**  Snakes are cold-blooded, so they often bask in the sun to warm up. Stretching out helps them absorb more heat.\n* **Communication:**  Some snakes use body language, including stretching, to communicate with each other"], "doc_hash": "376be775cef7060297649d1a8095eee4071ad36255b7616a6b2e5f98cb9dcb11", "prompt_hash": "23c3963ffc8da3e3f8f6468203f26e8d88f88af7b85f49c3b19c8e294d843fd4", "target_hash": "533f6616d76a7f290a5ce94da88d91634d26587dafa416c2c30fc7e634954f87", "bleu_max": 3.773881547728683, "bleu_acc": 1, "bleu_diff": 0.09810678167564824}
